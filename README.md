📊 Web Traffic & Conversion Analysis 
📋 Project Overview
This project performs a deep-dive analysis into website traffic data for the first quarter of 2025. By processing user session logs, the analysis identifies key trends in user behavior, referral effectiveness, and conversion success across various devices and platforms.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:

pandas: Data cleaning and transformation

matplotlib: Core charting and visualization

seaborn: Advanced statistical plots

📂 Dataset Specification
The analysis is based on the WebTraffic_Q1_2025.csv dataset, which includes the following attributes:


VisitDate: The date of the session.


SessionDuration: Time spent on site (seconds).


PageViews: Number of pages visited during a session.


ReferralSource: Traffic origin (Organic, Paid, Social, Direct, Email, Referral).


DeviceType: Hardware used (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).


Conversions: Binary indicator of success (1 = Converted, 0 = Not Converted).

🔍 Key Analysis Modules
1. Data Cleaning & Engineering
Date Parsing: Converts strings to datetime objects to extract Month, Day of Week, and Week Number.

Missing Value Handling:

SessionDuration: Filled using the mean value.

PageViews: Filled using the median value.

2. Traffic Trend Analysis
Daily Volume: A line plot showing session counts over time to identify peak traffic days.

Weekly Trends: A comparative analysis of traffic growth across January, February, and March.

3. Engagement Metrics
Averages: Calculation of site-wide average session duration and page views.

Top Channels: A horizontal bar chart highlighting the top 5 referral sources by volume.

4. Conversion Insights
Overall Rate: Total conversions divided by total sessions to determine the Q1 conversion percentage.

Source Distribution: A pie chart showing which referral sources are most likely to result in a conversion.

5. Device Performance
UX Analysis: Compares average session duration across Desktop, Mobile, and Tablet.

Device Conversion: A grouped bar chart evaluating which device type has the highest conversion efficiency.

6. Bounce Rate Monitoring
Threshold Analysis: A daily line graph of bounce rates with a 70% threshold line to flag days of poor user retention.

🚀 Getting Started
Dependencies:

Bash

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Data Setup: Ensure WebTraffic_Q1_2025 - WebTraffic_Q1_2025.csv.csv is in the same directory as the script.

Run:

Bash

python untitled5.py
